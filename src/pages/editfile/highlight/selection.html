<blockquote>
  <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the
  countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.<br>
  Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the
  Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden
  flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.</p>

  <p>It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences
  fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control
  about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day
  however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided
  to leave for the far World of Grammar.<br>
  The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
  of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the
  Little Blind Text didn’t listen.<br>
  She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
  made herself on the way.</p>

  <p>When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains,
  she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown
  Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline
  of her own road, the Line Lane.<br>
  Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then</p>
